## 🧪 Open Source, Work in Progress

Nebriq is open source and evolving.  
The current repo reflects the core codebase, but:

- Self-hosting instructions are not yet complete
- Some features rely on paid services (e.g. Tiptap Pro)
- Migrations and environment setup may change

We’re working toward a fully self-hostable, community-friendly version.  
In the meantime, feel free to explore the code, open issues, or contribute ideas 🙏
